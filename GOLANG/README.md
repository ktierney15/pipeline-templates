# Go pipeline
This pipeline will build and test your Go project, tag your repository with a version, and publish an artifact to a release

## Onboarding
1. Copy the .github directory to your project repository
2. initialize your go project with the following command:
```bash
go mod init github.com/yourusername/my-go-project
```
